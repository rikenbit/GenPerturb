# GenPerturb

## Overview
This repository provides scripts to create a deep learning model (Genomic DNA model) by fine-tuning pre-trained models registered on Hugging Face using DNA sequences as input. The resulting model is designed to predict gene expression changes induced by perturbations, such as those observed in Perturb-seq, based on the input DNA sequences.



## Requirements

## Setup Instructions

Create a virtual environment (recommended):



## Usage
The main script can be executed as follows:
```

```

Results will be saved in the results/ directory.
